Clutter

New year, new you. It's time to ask yourself the hard questions:

When was the last time I used _____ ?
Do I really need this app?
Is my life genuinely improved by having _____ installed on my mobile device?

Clutter offers a simple interface for you to go through your phone and evaluate each and every app you've downloaded. You already know the motions; swipe right to say yes, left to say no. Use it weekly, monthly, bi-anually. We all need to clean sometimes.

If you truly apply yourself, Clutter guarantees that your phone will be as pure as a newborn baby.
