<b>New year, new you. It's time to ask yourself the hard questions:</b>

When was the last time I used _____ ?
When was the last time I cleaned myself?
Am I getting distracted in class?
Did I forget to uninstall this worthless app last Wednesday?
Am I bad at this game? Do I need to uninstall?
Will I be happier if I had more system memory on my phone?
